    linked list is a DS used for storing collections for data

    Linked kist has the following properties=

    1> Succesive elements are conneted by pointers
    2> Last element points to null
    3> It can grow or shrink size during execution of a program
    4> It can be made just as long as required
    5> It does not waste memory space
    6> LL has the most memory flexibility 

    variable are dynamically allocated ie during execution of program so they dont have any name 
    IN c language we make dynamically allocated variable with the help of malloc(), calloc()

    There are 3 main oepration on LL 
    1> Insertion
    2> Deletion 
    3> Traversing
